# Spotify
 Working with Spotipy to access their API
 
 
I was using these:
	
Or any of the documentation
https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/working-with-playlists/

Web Interface with the API
https://developer.spotify.com/console/

You'll have to create and register an "app". This app is the Spotipy object used to make the connection to the API.
The system ENV variables I added was the client id, secret id, and localhost. I got them from my dashboard.
